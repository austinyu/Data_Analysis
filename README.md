This is the sample notebooks for analyzing and visualizing data from sensors at hydropower plants. The goal of these exploration is to find automatic outlier detection algorithms. These notebooks demonstrate the performance of isolation forest, 1.5 interquartile range, a combination of both, and local outlier filter.
